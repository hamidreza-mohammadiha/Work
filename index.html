        I feel that I need to start something big and long, but I'm not sure what that is. I've got some kind of sense, but it's not quite enough. So, I decided to write it here and put it on the web to see what will come.
        <br><br>
        It's started when I was (not)working on my thesis. I realized that the best way to solve a problem is to play it with your friends. it's significantly make sense but can not be proof easily. so I designed an experiment to find the equlibrium price in 3-level business strategiy move. Our professors was engaged but the boundry of the indivisual work, has shown it's limitation in many aspects. I've juxstaposed Investring, Marketing and Sales in a framework and trained a <strong style="color: #3498db;">Artificial Player</strong> manualy. 
        at the same time, I was imagining about my first book which is ought to be an interactive economic class for teenages. I'was blessed with this autopia as my mission.
        <br><br>
        I had it in many corners of my mind and kept exploring in business management careers for a while and now, a week before strating my first job as a product manager (a play maker indeed) I decived to start it asap.
        <br><br>
          In the midway, I should admid that I changeed my mission to read and translate the bible of game designers. The Art of Game Design by Schell.
          But it did'nt drafted either and I am going to solve all'em together. I started to write here.
          <br><br>
          Let's plot it out one more time.
          I want to paint a map which is trains (and gotted to be trained) in high schools as a free web3 room.
          <br><br>
          That was accurate but complicated. I should keep this in mind that this room should be the most popular class after sports and that means between mascular and femenine vibes Vertically, and between being serious and fun Horizontally.
          <br><br>
          Before diving into details I wanted to mention some supportive resources and refrences of this foundation, meanwhile tie by academic career in this road by a series of articles. A serie because I need a tempo and training in a smooth, enjoyable, challenging and unforgettable manner in my class. 
          So I need various maps to get to my point and I decided to leave my Logs here, if someones try to connect me or to rob me, I can be proud.
          <div>
          <br><br>
          Today is 10/26/2025, I'm in Tehran at my home trying to apply to TU/e for a suggested PhD position.
          <br> I'll be right back.
